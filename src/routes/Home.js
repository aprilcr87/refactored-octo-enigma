        Complete tests 1, 2, and 3 in any order. Types for each component have
        been provided so you know what to expect, but feel free to ignore
        Typescript if you're not familiar with it. If you'd like Typescript
        linting to be enabled, remove the TSlint disable rule at the top of each
        file. When you're done, commit the changes to a new branch with your
